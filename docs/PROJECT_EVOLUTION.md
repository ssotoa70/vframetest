## Detailed Feature Enhancements

### 1. Error Tracking (NEW - v25.11.23)

**What Was Missing**:
- No capture of system error codes
- No tracking of which frame failed
- No correlation between failures and threads
- No success rate metrics

**What's New**:
```c
// Error tracking structure captures:
- System errno value
- Operation type (open/read/write/close)
- Frame number that failed
- Thread ID
- Precise timestamp
- Human-readable error message
```

**Impact**: Users can now diagnose I/O failures, identify patterns, and understand exactly where problems occur.

### 2. Filesystem Detection (NEW - v25.11.23)

**What Was Missing**:
- No awareness of filesystem type
- No warnings for remote storage
- No accommodation for direct I/O limitations

**What's New**:
```
Automatic detection:
- LOCAL: Local storage (SSD/HDD)
- SMB: Samba/CIFS network shares
- NFS: Network File System
- OTHER: Unknown types

With automatic warnings:
- "WARNING: Test path is on a remote filesystem"
- "Direct I/O may not be available. Results may not be accurate."
```

**Impact**: Users understand why test results may vary, especially on network storage.

### 3. Multi-Platform Support (NEW - v25.11.21+)

**What Was Missing**:
- Windows builds completely absent
- macOS support limited to x86_64
- No universal binary support

**What's New**:
- ✅ Windows 32-bit and 64-bit support
- ✅ macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) + x86_64 universal binary
- ✅ Linux x86_64 with glibc compatibility
- ✅ Automated cross-compilation

**Impact**: Professionals can use vframetest on all major platforms without platform-specific workarounds.

### 4. Benchmarking Dashboard (NEW - v25.11.22)

**What Was Missing**:
- No historical performance tracking
- No automated data collection
- No visualization of trends

**What's New**:
- Automated benchmark data collection per build
- JSON format for programmatic access
- Dashboard infrastructure for trend analysis
- Historical performance tracking

**Impact**: Teams can monitor performance regressions and track improvements over time.

### 5. Custom Profiles (NEW - v25.11.22)

**What Was Missing**:
- Fixed set of profiles only
- No flexibility for custom resolutions
- No support for non-standard video formats

**What's New**:
- Define custom frame profiles with any resolution
- Support for multiple pixel depths
- Flexible configuration system
- User-defined compression options

**Impact**: Researchers and custom users can test with their exact workload parameters.

### 6. JSON Output (NEW - v25.11.22)

**What Was Missing**:
- Only CSV output available
- Not machine-readable for programmatic use
- Limited for integration with other tools

**What's New**:
```json
{
  "frames": 100,
  "bytes": 12884901888,
  "throughput_mibps": 1024.5,
  "fps": 175.3,
  "completion_times": {
    "min_ms": 3.2,
    "avg_ms": 5.7,
    "max_ms": 12.1
  }
}
```

**Impact**: Easy integration with dashboards, databases, and analytical tools.
