## Becoming a Maintainer

We welcome contributions and may invite active contributors to become maintainers. To be considered:

3. **Community Involvement**: Helpful engagement with other contributors
4. **Project Knowledge**: Deep understanding of the codebase and architecture

Potential maintainers will be discussed and invited by existing maintainers.

## Decision Making

### Small Changes (Documentation, Bug Fixes)
- Single maintainer approval required
- Quick turnaround expected

### Feature Changes
- At least two maintainers should review
- Discussion encouraged before implementation
- Community feedback considered

### Major Decisions (Architecture, Release Policy)
- All maintainers should be consulted
- Discussion via GitHub issues or discussions
- Consensus preferred

## Release Policy

- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- **Release Cycle**: Irregular, driven by feature completion and bug fixes
- **Pre-release**: Beta/RC releases for major versions
- **Supported Versions**: Latest version actively maintained

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from main
2. Update version numbers and documentation
3. Create release notes summarizing changes
4. Tag release on GitHub
5. Generate and verify artifacts for all platforms
6. Publish release and announce

## Conflict Resolution

If disagreements arise:

1. **Discussion**: Open, respectful discussion in issues or PR comments
2. **Consensus**: Try to reach agreement among affected parties
3. **Escalation**: If needed, maintainer lead makes final decision
4. **Documentation**: Decision and rationale documented

## Communication

- **GitHub Issues**: Feature requests, bug reports, discussions
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and feature implementation
- **Email**: ssotoa70@gmail.com for sensitive matters
- **GitHub Discussions**: For broader project discussions (if enabled)

## Standards

All contributors and maintainers must:

- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- Follow [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Maintain code quality and test coverage
- Update documentation with changes
- Respond professionally to feedback

## Inactive Maintainers

If a maintainer becomes inactive (no activity for 6+ months):

- Maintainer status may be updated
- Attempt to contact before changes
- Status updated in this document

## Code Ownership

While the project has a central maintainer, we embrace community ownership:

- Contributors own their contributions (within GPL v2 license)
- Community feedback shapes the project direction
- Long-term contributors gain influence on decisions
